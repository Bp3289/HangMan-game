Game Concept:

The goal is for the user to guess the word before the lives run out. If the user guesses the letter correct then a life will not be lost. If the user runs out of lives then the game is over. If the player corrects the word before the all the lives are lost then the user wins the game.


The way the game is constructed:

Form
Input Buttons(Submit, Reset)
Function that randmoly picks the word from an array of words.
A setup function that includes the letters, words, lives and messages
If else functions that react to the user's choice. 
Transitions on the input field so that the correct letters appear in green.
Red color in the placeholder
